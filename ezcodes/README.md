## Guess the Number Game 
Where you need to guess the number in the [1; n] range.</br>But the game helps you and tells, whether the entered number is less or greater than the answer!  
**Here are the rules**
- First you enter *n* and the game generates a random number
- Then the game offers you to make a guess
- After you entered something, the code will tell you: less or greater
- You can guess as long as you want, but the game counts your result :)
- If you guessed th result - game offers you to play one more time!
